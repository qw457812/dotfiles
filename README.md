# My personal dotfiles on macOS

Manage my dotfiles use [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

## [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo)

Hack my keyboard use [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements), and maintain [**__my karabiner config__**](./dot_config/karabiner.edn) with Goku.

Want to know more about karabiner and goku? Head over to [nikitavoloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)'s [**__personal wiki__**](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/)!

The reason why I make this repository public is that I want to share my goku config, it's awesome and life changing for me.
